/* Behavioral Design Patterns */
//Behavioral Design Patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

/* Observer */
//The one-to-many relationship between the numerous objects is the basis for this design pattern.
//It enables you to set up a subscription mechanism that permits other entities to be alerted of each occurrence on the entity to which you are subscribed
//An object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

//We will be taking an example of a person in which if a person falls ill, it will display a notification.
