/* Structural Design Patterns */
//These patterns concern class and object composition.
//They ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.
//They use inheritance to compose interfaces.

/* Bridge */
//Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies â€” abstraction and implementation
//which can be developed independently of each other.
//It separates the abstraction from the implementation so that the two can vary independently.

//We will be creating Renderer classes for rendering multiple shapes,

class VectorRenderer {
  renderCircle(radius) {
    console.log(`Drawing a circle of radius ${radius}`);
  }
}

class RasterRenderer {
  renderCircle(radius) {
    console.log(`Drawing pixels for circle of radius ${radius}`);
  }
}

class Shape {
  constructor(renderer) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(renderer, radius) {
    super(renderer);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  draw() {
    this.renderer.renderCircle(this.radius);
  }

  resize(factor) {
    this.radius *= factor;
  }
}

//This is how we will use it
let raster = new RasterRenderer();
let vector = new VectorRenderer();
let circle = new Circle(vector, 5);
circle.draw();
circle.resize(2);
